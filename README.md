# Stock-Board
This is the code for a stocks-board website I made. This only uses front-end development (HTML, CSS, &amp; JS).
Here are all the links I used for this project: 

1.) https://www.npmjs.com/package/express

2.) https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser

3.) https://www.npmjs.com/package/yahoo-stock-prices
